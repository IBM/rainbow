### Summary
This scaffolded application provides a starting point for creating Swift applications running on [Kitura](http://www.kitura.io/).

### Requirements
* [Swift 4](https://swift.org/download/)

### Project contents
This application has been generated with the following capabilities and services:

* [CloudEnvironment](#configuration)
* [Embedded metrics dashboard](#embedded-metrics-dashboard)
* [Docker files](#docker-files)
* [Iterative Development](#iterative-development)
* [IBM Cloud deployment](#ibm-cloud-deployment)
* [Cloudant](#cloudant)
* [Push Notifications](#push-notifications)

#### Embedded metrics dashboard
This application uses the [SwiftMetrics package](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/SwiftMetrics) to gather application and system metrics.

These metrics can be viewed in an embedded dashboard on `/swiftmetrics-dash`. The dashboard displays various system and application metrics, including CPU, memory usage, HTTP response metrics and more.
#### Docker files
The application includes the following files for Docker support:
* `.dockerignore`
* `Dockerfile`
* `Dockerfile-tools`

The `.dockerignore` file contains the files/directories that should not be included in the built docker image. By default this file contains the `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile-tools`. It can be modified as required.

The `Dockerfile` defines the specification of the default docker image for running the application. This image can be used to run the application.

The `Dockerfile-tools` is a docker specification file similar to the `Dockerfile`, except it includes the tools required for compiling the application. This image can be used to compile the application.

Details on how to build the docker images, compile and run the application within the docker image can be found in the [Run section](#run) below.
#### IBM Cloud deployment
Your application has a set of cloud deployment configuration files defined to support deploying your application to IBM Cloud:
* `manifest.yml`
* `.bluemix/toolchain.yml`
* `.bluemix/pipeline.yml`

The [`manifest.yml`](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/manageapps/depapps.html#appmanifest) defines options which are passed to the Cloud Foundry `cf push` command during application deployment.

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/index.html) service provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud, for both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes applications. The ["Create Toolchain"](#deploy-to-ibm-cloud) button creates a DevOps toolchain and acts as a single-click deploy to IBM Cloud including provisioning all required services.

#### Cloudant
This application uses the [Kitura-CouchDB package](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CouchDB), which allows Kitura applications to interact with a Cloudant or CouchDB database.

CouchDB speaks JSON natively and supports binary for all your data storage needs.

Boilerplate code for creating a client object for the Kitura-CouchDB API is included inside `Sources/Application/Application.swift` as an `internal` variable available for use anywhere in the `Application` module.

The connection details for this client are loaded by the [configuration](#configuration) code and are passed to the Kitura-CouchDB client in the boilerplate code.
#### Push Notifications
This application uses the [Push notifications package](https://github.com/ibm-bluemix-mobile-services/bms-pushnotifications-serversdk-swift), which is a Swift server-side SDK for sending push notifications via the IBM Cloud Push Notifications services.

Boilerplate code for creating a client object for the Push Notifications API is included inside `Sources/Application/Application.swift` as an `internal` variable available for use anywhere in the `Application` module.

The connection details for this client are loaded by the [configuration](#configuration) code and are passed to the Push Notifications client in the boilerplate code.

### Configuration
Your application configuration information is stored in the `config.json` in the project root directory. This file is in the `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being stored in git.

The connection information for any configured services, such as username, password and hostname, is stored in this file.

The application uses the [CloudEnvironment package](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/CloudEnvironment) to read the connection and configuration information from the environment and this file.

If the application is running locally, it can connect to IBM Cloud services using unbound credentials read from this file. If you need to create unbound credentials you can do so from the IBM Cloud web console ([example](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/tutorials/create_service.html#creating-a-service-instance)), or using the CloudFoundry CLI [`cf create-service-key` command](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-service-key.html).

When you push your application to IBM Cloud, these values are no longer used, instead the application automatically connects to bound services using environment variables.

### Run
To build and run the application:
1. `swift build`
1. `.build/debug/rainbow-server`

**NOTE**: On macOS you will need to add options to the `swift build` command: `swift build -Xlinker -lc++`

#### Docker
To build the two docker images, run the following commands from the root directory of the project:
* `docker build -t myapp-run .`
* `docker build -t myapp-build -f Dockerfile-tools .`
You may customize the names of these images by specifying a different value after the `-t` option.

To compile the application using the tools docker image, run:
* `docker run -v $PWD:/swift-project -w /swift-project myapp-build /swift-utils/tools-utils.sh build release`

To run the application:
* `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v $PWD:/swift-project -w /swift-project myapp-run sh -c .build-ubuntu/release/rainbow-server`

#### Iterative Development
The `iterative-dev.sh` script is included in the root of the generated Swift project and allows for fast & easy iterations for the developer. Instead of stopping the running Kitura server to see new code changes, while the script is running, it will automatically detect changes in the project's **.swift** files and recompile the app accordingly.

To use iterative development:
* For native OS, execute the `./iterative-dev.sh` script from the root of the project.
* With docker, shell into the tools container mentioned above, and run the `./swift-project/iterative-dev.sh` script.  File system changes are detected using a low-tech infinitely looping poll mechanism, which works in both local OS/filesystem and across host OS->Docker container volume scenarios.

### Deploy to IBM Cloud
You can deploy your application to Bluemix using:
* the [CloudFoundry CLI](#cloudfoundry-cli)
* an [IBM Cloud toolchain](#ibm-cloud-toolchain)

#### CloudFoundry CLI
You can deploy the application to IBM Cloud using the CloudFoundry command-line:
1. Install the Cloud Foundry command-line (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)
1. Ensure all configured services have been provisioned
1. Run `cf push` from the project root directory

The Cloud Foundry CLI will not provision the configured services for you, so you will need to do this manually using the IBM Cloud web console ([example](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/Cloudant/tutorials/create_service.html#creating-a-service-instance)) or the CloudFoundry CLI (`cf create-service` command)[http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-service.html]. The service names and types will need to match your [configuration](#configuration).

#### IBM Cloud toolchain
You can also set up a default IBM Cloud Toolchain to handle deploying your application to IBM Cloud. This is achieved by publishing your application to a publicly accessible github repository and using the "Create Toolchain" button below. In this case configured services will be automatically provisioned, once, during toolchain creation.
